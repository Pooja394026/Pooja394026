# Hello World!! 🤖

I’m Pooja—an Analytics Architect, AI strategist, and a firm believer that if a task takes more than five minutes, there’s an AI agent waiting to be built for it.

I specialize in engineering high-integrity data pipelines and designing immersive dashboards that don't just show numbers—they tell the "why" behind the "what." While my heart lies in deep analytics and process automation, I’m no stranger to the data science lab, training models to predict the next big trend before it hits the radar.

### 🚀 What I'm Building:
* **AI-First Workflows:** I’m an AI enthusiast on a mission to automate the mundane. I’m currently implementing LLMs and custom AI tools to ensure my analytical work is 100% efficient and 0% repetitive.
* **Strategic Insights:** Bridging the gap between raw data and executive decisions with dashboards that provide clarity in a world of noise.
* **Continuous Optimization:** If there's a way to make a query run faster or a process smoother, I'm already on it.

### 🌶️ When the Screen is Off:
* **Fusion Culinary Lab:** I treat my kitchen like a data experiment—mixing flavors that shouldn't work together but somehow do. It’s 10% recipe, 90% "let's see what happens."
* **Global Explorer:** A serial traveler constantly looking for new data points (and passport stamps) across the globe.

Forever curious, mostly automated, and always experimenting.
